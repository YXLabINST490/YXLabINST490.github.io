YX Lab Website Prototpye

This website has been created to serve as a prototype for the University of Maryland YX Lab. 

This site was developed by applying the Makeability Lab's website's infrastructure and redevloping the content and navigation to suit the context of YX Lab.
Makeability Lab: https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/

By inspecting this site's framework, we were able to draft a prototype that could then be used to guide the development of the final version, such as with a premium Wordpress environment.
